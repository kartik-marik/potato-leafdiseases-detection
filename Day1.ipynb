        "*   Farmers who grow potatoes are facing lot of economic losses every year because of various diseases that can happen to a potato plant.\n",
        "*   There are two common diseases known as early blight and late blight.early blight is caused by fungus and late blight is caused by a specific micro-organism.\n",
        "*   so if a farmer can detect these diseases early and apply appropriate treatment then it can save lot of waste and prevent the economic loss.\n",
